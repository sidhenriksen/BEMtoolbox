This provides the development version of BEMtoolbox. BEMunit provides the
base class for simulating binocular energy model units. This class also 
allows for extending the standard BEM framework to incorporate arbitrary
nonlinearities. The demos directory gives some demonstrations for how
to use the toolbox, including how to compute a disparity tuning curve.
