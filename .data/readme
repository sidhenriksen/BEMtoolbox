These are the files that get contain the monocular responses.
A hash function takes each bem and rds object and converts it into a
unique identifier. Each bem object-rds object combination gets its own csv file.

Column 1 corresponds to the left eye response of the first subunit, column
2 to the right eye response of the first subunit, column 3 the left eye response
of the second subunit, and so on. (L1, R1, L2, R2, L3, R3, ...).
